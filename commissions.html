<h5>Produced by self-taught Portrait Artist, Amelia Radcliffe, <i>Amelia Florence Portraits</i>
	are a collection of oil and pencil animal portraits. Amelia specialises in animal portraiture and architectural drawings. 
	The majority of her work is in either oil on canvas, pencil on paper or chalks on paper but she is happy to work with any special requests.</h5>
<div id='bold'><h5><strong>How do commissions work?</strong></h5></div>
<h5>In order to capture the personality of the animals I ask for multiple high quality photographs. 
For convenience, I usually ask you to send me the photos via email as I work on a nationwide basis and therefore can be difficult to take the photos myself. 
I will then liaise with you in order to capture a perfect likeness and pose.</h5> 

<h5>I will then start to create the portrait. 
The time it takes to complete can vary according to workload. 
I typically ask for the photos at least 2 months before you wish the commission to be completed. 
However in special circumstances I can work around time constraints (extra charges may apply).</h5>

<h5>I usually work on paper or canvas around A3 or 30X30cm in size but am happy to work to whatever scales you would like. 
I can also work on linen coloured canvas, white canvas and different coloured paper/card to meet your wishes.</h5>

<h5>Typically my artwork is sold unframed. 
I am also happy to work with you if you wish for me to frame the piece (again extra framing and delivery charges will apply).</h5>  

<h5>I am happy to post commissions via Royal Mail Special Delivery (recorded and insured). 
Postage prices will vary depending on size and weight.</h5>

<h5>Each commission is individually priced on request.</h5> 

<h5>If you are interested please do not hesitate to get in contact either via email:amelia.florence.portraits@gmail.com or mobile: 07775991142</h5>
